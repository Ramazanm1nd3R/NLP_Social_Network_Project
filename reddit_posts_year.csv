"Cleaning my depression flat after months of being in a bad place 

Hi,

I just wanted to share my before and after of my living room & kitchen.. mostly because I'm proud but also because when I was trying to start this, I couldn't find much on the internet & that made me feel worse. 

This is a build up of being depressed for months, if not years, just scraping by. So please, no judgement. Eventually it got to the point there was just no more space to do anything, couldn't cook or have a space to relax and it made my depression worse.. I took a week off work & this is what I managed. There's still the bedroom, but I'm waiting on my new bed & drawers being delivered. Then next is the second bedroom which is piled high with just junk and rubbish, it's overwhelming, so taking a few days to recoup then I'll start there. Tips welcome!",136031,5762,2024-07-30 12:36:24,Text

"(OC) Overweight since childhood - no energy, no motivation, and a growing pile of health issues until I decided to make a change  Hey everyone!

I‚Äôll give a background for anyone interested and a TLDR at the bottom

When I was 12 years old I was already over 200 pounds - the fattest kid in the class / among his social group. I‚Äôve been huge since my youngest memories 

By the time my 23rd birthday was coming up I was nearly 300 pounds and the health issues were overwhelming- terrible back pain, 
no energy, no motivation, brutal brain fog, my mobility was going away as the weight increased. People were constantly telling me I looked over 40 years old

I knew I shouldn‚Äôt be feeling so shitty at such a young age and decided there was no way I could continue down this path 

I woke up October 20, 2021 looked into the mirror and told myself today is the day I start and never go back

By August 2022 I lost over 100 pounds

Since then I‚Äôve continued to maintain the weight loss while working on adding muscle - it‚Äôs been 2 years since I ‚Äúfinished‚Äù and I have not gained back any substantial weight / fat besides muscle

I started with a calorie deficit and exercise routine I developed that focused on minimizing loose skin by retaining as much muscle as possible 

No fad diets, no cutting out sugars or foods, no surgeries, no weird miracle products or any BS. Just a calorie deficit and solid routine / nutrition



TLDR

Lost over 100+ pounds naturally through calorie deficit and exercise",128504,2927,2024-08-30 16:13:35,Text

"A man whose wife was lost in japan's 2011 tsunami still goes diving every week in hope of finding her body, 11 years later Yasuo Takamatsu has spent more than ten years looking for his wife Yuko's remains in order to lay her to rest. The search began after the Japan tsunami in 2011 which affected the area of Fukushima. 

Now in the years since, Takamatsu dives weekly and has done for over a decade to see if he can find her body.

Despite various searches, there has been little other clue of where Yuko's body could be but Takamatsu holds out hope

After searching on land for two and a half years, the then-56-year-old started taking diving lessons in September 2013. While he didn't find learning to dive easy, the devoted husband has explained that he's motivated by wanting to find her body

Takamatsu dives alongside the help of a diving instructor, Masayoshi Takahashi. Takahashi leads volunteer dives to look for missing tsunami victims and has been helping Takamatsu

In an interview for short film 'The Diver', Takamatsu explained: ""I do want to find her, but I also feel that she may never be discovered as the ocean is way too vast - but I have to keep looking.",117905,1154,2024-08-16 05:20:41,Image

"I turned 72 today Here‚Äôs 32 things I‚Äôve learned that I hope help you in your journey:

1. It‚Äôs usually better to be nice than right.
2. Nothing worthwhile comes easy.¬†
3. Work on a passion project, even just 30 minutes a day. It compounds.
4. Become a lifelong learner (best tip).
5. Working from 7am to 7pm isn‚Äôt productivity. It‚Äôs guilt.
6. To be really successful become useful.
7. Like houses in need of repair, problems usually don‚Äôt fix themselves.
8. Envy is like drinking poison expecting the other person to die.
9. Don‚Äôt hold onto your ‚Äúgreat idea‚Äù until it‚Äôs too late.
10. People aren‚Äôt thinking about you as much as you think.¬†
11. Being grateful is a cheat sheet for happiness. (Especially today.)
12. Write your life plan with a pencil that has an eraser.¬†
13. Choose your own path or someone will choose it for you.
14. Never say, I‚Äôll never‚Ä¶
15. Not all advice is created equal.
16. Be the first one to smile.
17. The expense of something special is forgotten quickly.¬†The experience lasts a lifetime. Do it.
18. Don‚Äôt say something to yourself that you wouldn‚Äôt say to someone else.¬†
19. It‚Äôs not how much money you make.¬†It‚Äôs how much you take home.
20. Feeling good is better than that ‚Äúthird‚Äù slice of pizza.
21. Who you become is more important than what you accomplish.¬†
22. Nobody gets to their death bed and says, I‚Äôm sorry for trying so many things.
23. There are always going to be obstacles in your life. Especially if you go after big things.
24. The emptiest head rattles the loudest.
25. If you don‚Äôt let some things go, they eat you alive.
26. Try to spend 12 minutes a day in quiet reflection, meditation, or prayer.
27. Try new things. If it doesn‚Äôt work out, stop. At least you tried.
28. NEVER criticize, blame, or complain.¬†¬†
29. You can‚Äôt control everything. Focus on what you can control.
30. If you think you have it tough, look around.
31. It's only over when you say it is.
32. One hand washes the other and together they get clean. Help someone else.

If you're lucky enough to get up to my age, the view becomes more clear. It may seem like nothing good is happening to you, or just the opposite. Both will probably change over time.¬†

I'm still working (fractionally), and posting here, because business and people are my mojo. I hope you find yours.¬†

Onward!

Louie

"I bought a house and this guy ran inside immediately. Apparently the elderly woman who lived here had him, so I guess I have a cat now?? The neighbours have been looking after him from what I gather, but he stays strictly outside. I‚Äôm going to speak with them and see what happens from there. 


He sleeps in my garden all day and spent the first three days trying to get in the house before a friend filled me in on who he is. 


When I finally let him in he bolted to the master bedroom and purred loudly in there for like 10 minutes üòøüòª",91440,2300,2024-08-28 22:34:15,Text
"I had a student hit a new low the other day. I am now fearful the next generation will be the death of me. For context, I am a professor of communication located somewhere in the United States. Pray this did not happen at a college near you.

Usually, I can take a lot of things in stride. When it comes to students, I would like to think that I can handle practically anything. Teaching at an institution where many students are first-generation college attendees will always bring unique challenges. I realize that many do not have much life experience to work with, nor have they traveled to different places. I must keep it in mind as I work with them daily. If I didn‚Äôt do that, I would probably snap,

One student recently pushed me to the limit of my stupidity tolerance. I knew I was in for a long semester when she openly admitted during the first week of class that she was only in college to earn her MRS. It was the first time I ever heard this spoken aloud. For the sake of this story, I will now call her Ms. Manhunter. She was looking for a husband to marry who would take care of her. Our school has exceptional law and medical schools, so I think she was haunting those halls hoping to find Mr. Right-Now. 

However, I knew Ms. Manhunter would be a handful for whomever she was with when she dropped a little nugget of knowledge that floored me. Her words still haunt me, and I am considering chiseling her quote on my grave marker so that it will never vanish into the ether of history. I tasked Ms. Manhunter‚Äôs class with formulating a persuasive speech. I let students work in groups because I figured they should pitch their ideas to the people who would hear what they presented. I walked around the room, giving points to consider as they concocted their ideas. When I arrived at the group with little Ms. Manhunter, a student proposed that we should colonize the moon. This topic sounds like a great speech, but I must interject my sarcastic two cents. I mentioned that I believed we should blow the moon up, just like Alexander Abian proposed in the 1990s.

The student I was talking to understood that I was joking. However, Ms. Manhunter did not grasp that my reply was dripping with sarcasm. She promptly replied without hesitation that **if we blew up the moon, there would no longer be night**. The moment those words hit my ear, everything stopped. The little hamster in my brain decided it was time to go on vacation because I couldn't formulate a sentence responding to her blithering lunacy. Thankfully, the first student recognized that I was having problems and tried her best to explain to Ms. Manhunter how night and day worked. Even with the explanation, **she still insisted that the moon brings nighttime like the sun brings daylight**. I do not drink, but this was one moment in my life when I seriously considered taking up the habit.",91372,5963,2024-09-04 14:01:59,Text

"‚ÄúThe Smiling Disaster Girl‚Äù Zo√´ Roth sold her original photo for nearly $500,000 as a non-fungible token (NFT) at an auction in 2021 In January 2005, Zo√´ Roth and her father Dave went to see a controlled burn - a fire intentionally started to clear a property - in their neighbourhood in Mebane, North Carolina.

Mr Roth, an amateur photographer, took a photo of his daughter smiling mischievously in front of the blaze.

After winning a photography prize in 2008, the image went viral when it was posted online. 

Ms Roth has sold the original copy of her meme as a NFT for 180 Ethereum, a form of cryptocurrency, to a collector called @3FMusic.

The NFT is marked with a code that will allow the Roths - who have said they will split the profit - to keep the copyright and receive 10% of profits from future sales.
